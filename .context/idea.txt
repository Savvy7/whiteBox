the idea a learning site where you make interactive graphs. is that I wan to learn visually how things are connected, I usually think most tools as a blackbox when using them in a work, for example idk too deeply about DL/AI, i just know the flow input->hidden -> output; there's activation , optimizations, loss functions - the internal workings of which i dont really know. if only i could "click into" these blackboxes and learn about them. Basically you ask about a problem in natural language, like "can you explain how img2imag gen works, using a comfyUI workflow as example" then it create's a graph/workflow to the side which you can interact with, add notes, if you click on node and ask to explain it'll zoom in and show an internal workflow( maybe animations- too hard for now) , and you can ask doubts about nodes in the workflow in chat and it'll explain.
